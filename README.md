Profiler
=========

Profiler is a command line program used to process Salesforce Profile metadata quickly and easily.  Currently best used in conjunction with the ant migration tool to retrieve the metadata files from Salesforce, however, the plan is to eventually build a full fledged web application providing user interface to login to Salesforce, select the desired metadata, and specify file paths.

Installation
--------------

```sh
go get github.com/tpoche/profiler
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tpoche/profiler
mkdir out
mkdir profiles
go run profiler.go -f=true -o="Account,Contact,CustomObject__c"
```

As of current state, folder structure shown above is a requirement as only the base path is configurable in the program.  Place the .profile files that you'd like to process into the profiles folder and any output generated by the program will be placed into the[out fold
